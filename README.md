# Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Algorithm

## Overview
This Python script implements the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for outlier detection. LOF is an unsupervised algorithm that measures the local deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors. It is useful for identifying outliers in datasets where the density of the data points varies.

## Code Description
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The script loads the Iris dataset, performs some basic preprocessing steps such as checking for null values and duplicates, and visualizes the dataset using scatter plots.
2. **KNN Algorithm for LOF**: The script implements the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to calculate the LOF values for each data point in the test set.
3. **Visualization of LOF**: It visualizes the LOF values as scatter points to identify outliers in the dataset.
4. **LOF using `sklearn`**: Additionally, the script demonstrates how to use the `LocalOutlierFactor` class from the `sklearn.neighbors` module to perform LOF-based outlier detection. It also visualizes the results using scatter plots.
5. **Visualization Before and After LOF**: The script provides visualization of the dataset before and after LOF-based outlier detection to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

## How to Use
1. Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Adjust the parameters such as the dataset file path, the number of neighbors (`k`), and the number of features as needed.
4. Run the script and observe the visualization of LOF-based outlier detection results.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of outlier detection algorithms.
- Familiarity with Python programming and data manipulation.

## Notes
- LOF is effective in identifying outliers in datasets with varying densities and complex structures.
- Choosing an appropriate value for the number of neighbors (`k`) is crucial for the performance of the LOF algorithm.
- Visualization of LOF results helps in understanding the distribution of outliers and inliers in the dataset.

Experiment with different datasets and parameter settings to observe the behavior of the LOF algorithm in outlier detection.
